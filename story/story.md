## **Story **

The teacher looked at his gaping shoes and tattered clothes and knew she had to find out what was really going on at home or this kid would end up in the system. She called him up to her desk and asked, "Do you want to help me on a project this weekend?" He looked at her and nodded his head, keeping silent the entire time. The class carried on as per normal after the teacher asked that question. Even though his stoic face remained throughout the entire class, he felt a mix of emotions in him. *Did I do something wrong? Why would she ask me to help her? Why not anyone else? At least I won't have to spend the weekend with... him.*
